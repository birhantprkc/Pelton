// Pelton syncing with no visible way to get it back or quit it; the tray icon
// is that way. Left click reopens the window, right click shows the menu
// below, wired to the same runtime calls and menu action events as the native
// menu. What serves the icon is per platform: tray_windows.go for the
// notification area, tray_linux.go for the StatusNotifierItem on the session
// bus. macOS has no tray, the Dock icon reopens the hidden window there.
