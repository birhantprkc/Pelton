// SetDockBadge puts the unread count on the dock icon, or the unread dot on
// the tray icon on Windows and Linux. The frontend calls it
// whenever the unified inbox count changes, which already covers syncing, marking
// read and deleting, so there is no second count to keep in step here.
//
// A no-op anywhere with neither; see dockbadge_other.go.

// applyDockBadge pushes the remembered count to the platform, or clears the
// badge when the setting is off. Also called when that setting changes, so
// turning it back on does not wait for the next sidebar refresh. The lock is
// held through the push so two calls racing cannot land an older count last.
